<h1>Turko's GUI Library 1.2</h1>
This is a Python GUI Library build to improve on the inconsistencies and unnecessary confusing manner of the Tkinter GUI Library which is built into Python. Turko-lib is designed to be more similar to the style of interface design that web frameworks have and aims to implement similar features such as content justification and item alignment.
